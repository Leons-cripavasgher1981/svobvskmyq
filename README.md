Whoo boy, Riff Raff, man... just got out and my brain's still doing somersaults. Imagine a bulldozer trying to dance ballet, but instead of an audience, it's just a clowder of stray cats in the alley behind a jazz club. That's what this   felt like, sort of. But, oh! The popcorn everywhere—stuck to my jeans, a kernel in my shoe, and the backache reaching monumental levels like I sat on a chair made of wet spaghetti. 

The opening scene, oh wait, did it open with a chase or was it the bizarre monologue where the guy was trying to build a paper castle in his living room? Hard to remember. It was like trying to follow a plot through a carnival's funhouse mirror. There was this moment, not sure if it was real or one of those cinema mirages, where a character just sat down on a couch deep in thought, and I swore I saw it start raining indoors. Why was it raining indoors? Just... why?!

> Oh, and the soundtrack! Bananas—someone took all the elevator music from the 70s, threw it in a blender with some 𝘮𝘰𝘥ern techno beats, and said, Yes, this is what the people need. But you know what? It kinda worked. Felt like a circus on Mars, right where it touches the sun.

People say you should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   if you can’t make it to the cinema - honestly I’d say prepare your senses with meditation or something first. There was a part towards the end, with this unexpected dance-off where two characters who might’ve been frenemies or lost grocery store employees went at it like octopuses playing chess.

And the theater itself—noisy! Could barely focus on half the dialogue because the folks behind me were discussing the price of organic bananas. Can you imagine? Movies like this... they’re an experience. Like when you’re trying to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   and a stray thought about alpacas wearing socks pops in your mind. But lovely in a way, like a cat knocking over your favorite plant.

Anyway, Peter or was it Steve? Someone asked if they should 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 or 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Tricky question after this rollercoaster madness. Like, proceed at your own peril, but who am I to stop a curious soul?

Here's that accidental thing that got pasted in, ignore it:

```csharp
void RandomMethod()
{
    List<int> numbers = null;
    foreach(var n in numbers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(n); // I mean, always bring a towel!
    }
}
```
